# CSCI S-33a: Project Proposal
## Due: Friday, July 27 at 6pm

#### Your name

Subin Kim

#### Your teaching fellow's name

Alex Mariona

#### Which language(s) will you use for your project?

Python and PostreSQL (and JavaScript, probably)

#### What will (likely) be the title of your project?

Your New England

#### In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (e.g. "A website that lets you check the weather in different cities.")

A website that lets you rate your experience at some of the big cities in New England and share your trip schedule
with the other users.

#### Where will your project ultimately live? (e.g. within CS50 IDE, Heroku, AWS, some commerical web host...)

CS50 IDE

#### In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will it do? What features will it have?

This website will have two main features: rating and sharing. First, the users can give ratings to the cities in
New England, based on their exprience. The criteria for the ratings will be 'is the city safe', 'is the city clean',
'are residents hospitable to the tourists', 'is the food generally delicious', and 'are there lots of tourists attractions'.

The ratings will be represented in the form of stars and each star will worth 2 points (10 points = maximum). The website will
also calculate the average rating given to each city.

On the search pane, users would be able to filter different places by the average rating, state, and name of the city.
I will put in randomly generated data into the database just for simulation purpose.

The users would also be able to share their trip schedule. They would need to enter the list of cities they have visited,
the amount of time they had spent at each city (e.g. 5 days, 3 hours, 2 weeks) and the transportation they have used in
order to move between different cities. Other users could then comment and press like if they liked the schedule.

There will be a separate search pane for the trip schedules, and by default, they will be arranged by the number of likes
they received.

- In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

#### In a sentence or list, define a GOOD outcome for your project. What WILL you accomplish no matter what?

A website with the first function - 'rating' fully implemented.

#### In a sentence or list, define a BETTER outcome for your project. What do you THINK you will accomplish in time?

A website with the second function - 'sharing' fully implemented.

#### In a sentence or list, define a BEST outcome for your project. What do you HOPE you will accomplish in time?

A website with login & search fully implemented.

#### In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills do you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research?

More about making an efficient use of databases.
