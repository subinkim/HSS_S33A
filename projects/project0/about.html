                <strong>My Hometown</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>As I have briefly mentioned in the home page of the website, I am from South Korea,
                        which is part of East Asia, between Japan and China. Among hundreds of cities in Korea, I was born and raised
                         on an island called "Jeju", which is the island on the south of the peninsula. </li>
                    <li>The island retains the original beauty of its nature, including the blue, shining sea that encompasses the island
                        , and Mt. Halla that stands audaciously at the heart of Jeju. It is also known for the small mountains which
                        were created when Mt. Halla, which was an active volcano in the past, erupted. </li>
                    <li>0.7 million people reside on this island with 1850km<sup>2</sup> of area, including 20 000 people of foreign nationality.</li>
                    <li>The main industries on the island are agriculture and tourism. Hence, it is a boring place for young people like me,
                    who prefer visiting theme parks than walking through the forests.</li>
                    <li>The island carries huge values in science. Due to its nature of being a volcanic island, its topographical features
                    are an important source of study. The island itself with its lava tubes is UNESCO world heritage site, and the UNESCO
                    describes them as follows: <em>"The site, of outstanding aesthetic beauty, also bears testimony to the history of the planet, its features and processes."</em></li>

                <strong>My Schools</strong><br><br>
                So far I have attended 3 different schools (as I have transferred once) and I will be attending a new school this fall in America.
                 But among all those schools that I have attended or that I will attend, I would like to introduce the third one, which I have attended until this June.
                Deciding to attend that school was one of the best choices I have made in my life, since it set me a path to follow.
                <br> When I first entered the school as a new 7th grader, computer science was a mandatory course for me. And that was when I first experienced coding.
                We learnt Python and made a game with it, which has been engraved in myself as a pleasant memory. I felt a strong attachment to coding and programming, hence I decided to study more about it.
                Now I can program in several languages, and am seriously thinking about my future with computer science. And I really want to thank my school, which is now my 'previous' school, for being such a wonderful place,
                 where I could develop my dreams and discover my true self.
            </p> <br>

            <p id = "dreams">
                <strong>My dreams</strong><br><br>
                I want to be a computer scientist in the future. I will not write in too much detail, because you will find out what my dreams and aspirations are, later in the future.
